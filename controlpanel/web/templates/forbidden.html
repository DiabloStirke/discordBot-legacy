                        This website and the associated Discord bot, <i>Diablo Strike</i>, are fan-made projects created by me. The content, including the name, design, and inspiration, is derived from a specific video game ability (OGM-72 'DIABLO' Strike) associated with a character (Captain) from Risk of Rain 2. This project is purely for personal enjoyment and is not intended for any commercial use.
