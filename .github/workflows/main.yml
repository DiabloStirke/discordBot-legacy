# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: CI

# Controls when the workflow will run
on:
  # Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events but only for the "master" branch
  push:
    branches: [ "master" ]
#  pull_request:
 #   branches: [ "master" ]

  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
  workflow_dispatch:

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  deploy:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: [self-hosted]

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
      # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3

      # Runs a set of commands using the runners shell
      - name: Run docker container
        run: |
          echo "COMMIT_MESSAGE=${{ github.event.head_commit.message }}" >> .env
          docker compose up -d --build --force-recreate
        
      - name: Cleanup docker  container
        run: |
